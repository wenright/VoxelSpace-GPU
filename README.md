# VoxelSpace-GPU
GPU accelerated Comanche style voxel engine using GLSL shader

Voxel renderers are really cool, and I liked [VoxelSpace](http://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace). But, at least on the web demo, performance was not great. I was getting around 20 FPS. With nearly the same algorithm on my GPU, I get around 500 FPS.

This project is based off of [VoxelSpace](http://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace)
